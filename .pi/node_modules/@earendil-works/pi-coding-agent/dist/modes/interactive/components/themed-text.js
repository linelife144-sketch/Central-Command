 * Text whose content applies theme colors. Plain `Text` keeps the colors its string was built with, so
 * a theme change, or the system theme receiving the terminal's colors, would leave it stale. This
 * rebuilds the string from `build` after every invalidation, which the UI performs on theme changes.
 *
 * `build` must return the same content each time, apart from colors. Snapshot changing data before
 * creating the component, or call `invalidate()` after changing state that `build` reads.
