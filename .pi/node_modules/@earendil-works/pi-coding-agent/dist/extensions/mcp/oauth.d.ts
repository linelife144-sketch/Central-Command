 * `McpOAuthAuthorizationRequiredError`, and the user signs in through `/mcp`, which runs
 * the authorization code flow (PKCE, a Client ID Metadata Document or dynamic client registration)
 * against a loopback callback.
 *
 * Credentials live in `<agent-dir>/mcp-auth.json`, keyed by server name and URL.
