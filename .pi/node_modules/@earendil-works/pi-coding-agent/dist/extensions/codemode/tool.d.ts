/**
 * The `codemode` tool: the model writes JavaScript that calls other tools. Scripts use `tools`,
 * `ALL_TOOLS`, `text()`, `image()`, `exit()`, `store()`/`load()`, `console.*`, and `return <value>`,
 * may start with a `// @options:` line, and reach the model catalog, classifiers, and image models
 * through `models.*`. Results start with a "Script completed" or "Script failed" header.
 *
 * Scripts can call the agent loop's nested tools: active `direct` tools and every `codemode` or
 * `deferred` tool. Nested calls run through the agent loop's tool pipeline (`ctx.executeTool`), so
 * validation, `tool_call`/`tool_result` hooks, and permission checks apply exactly as for direct
 * calls. Only the script's output reaches the model; nested results do not.
 *
 * Nested results are handed to the script as follows:
 * - A tool that declares `outputSchema` resolves to its `structuredContent`, also for error
 *   results that carry one (MCP tools resolve to their `CallToolResult`, including `isError`).
 * - Any other tool resolves to its text content as one string.
 * - A failed, blocked, or invalid call rejects with an Error carrying the tool's error text.
 *
 * A script that fails returns a normal error result that keeps its partial output, followed by
 * "Script error:" and the error. `store(key, value)` and `load(key)` keep JSON values across
 * calls; successful scripts append their writes to the session as `codemode-store` custom entries,
 * so each branch sees the values written on its own path.
